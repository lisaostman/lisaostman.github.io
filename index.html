            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>It took me the longest time to figure out what to write in this section- and then I decided to begin like this! After all,
            that is a pretty good indicator of personality already. A bit about me? I was born in Sweden and moved here when I was six. I was
            chucked into Year One without a single shred of English in my, save for one phrase: "may I please use to bathroom?" (My mum figured this was 
            important.)
            </p>
            <p>
            Since then, I've actually grown to love English. I am currently writing a book trilogy and love to read. Additionally, I find programming immensely
            interesting - a subject of seemingly infinite possibilities.
