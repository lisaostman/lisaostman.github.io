# Porfolio Page

## What is this little corner of the internet?
It is a place for me to continually update my projects and log my growing knowledge into the world of full stack development... Think of it as a timeline into what I used to know, what I know, and what I wish to soon learn. Here I will keep my past projects.

### What Past Projects?
Currently, there are none to show but they will be placed here when the time is right. For now this webpage itself is an account of what I know so far. 

### Future Projects?
In the future I hope to gain a clearer understanding of bootstrap and commit it toward this github repository to test my knowledge. I want to learn so much more! 

## Why, How, Where?
Those are the key questions.

### Why did I embark on this journey?
To see where I could go, and to inspire me to pursue it even further. The only way to learn is to jump head first in after all.

### What were you hardest moments?
Positioning, positioning, positioning. Every day I understand it a bit better, but every day it gives me a headeache or too haha. 

### Where do you want this project to take you?
To a place where I find a whole new world of even more programming skills that I want to discover!
